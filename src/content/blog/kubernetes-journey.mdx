# My Journey Learning Kubernetes

As I continue my DevOps journey, learning Kubernetes has been both challenging and rewarding. Here's what I've learned so far and what you can expect when starting with K8s.

## Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes solves several challenges in container orchestration:
- Automated deployment and scaling
- Load balancing
- Self-healing capabilities
- Service discovery and configuration

## Key Components

- **Pods**: Smallest deployable units
- **Deployments**: Manage pod replicas
- **Services**: Network abstraction
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets**: Configuration management

## Getting Started

1. Set up a local environment (minikube/kind)
2. Learn basic kubectl commands
3. Understand pod lifecycle
4. Practice with simple applications
