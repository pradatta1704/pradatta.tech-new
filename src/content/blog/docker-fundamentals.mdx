# Docker Fundamentals for DevOps Engineers

Docker has revolutionized how we deploy and manage applications. Let's explore the fundamental concepts and best practices.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent environments that package everything needed to run an application.

## Key Concepts

- **Images**: Read-only templates for containers
- **Containers**: Running instances of images
- **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building images
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining multi-container applications

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Pull an image
docker pull nginx

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx

# List containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id
```
